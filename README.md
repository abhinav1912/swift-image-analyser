# SwiftImageAnalyser

My main goal with this application was to learn how ML models can be used on device to make predictions. Current set of features:

1. select an image from the gallery and run various prediction models on it
2. allow the user to fine tune the number of predictions and confidence threshold for each detection request

The models that are being used:
- ResNet50
- SqueezeNet
- MobileNetV2

### Upcoming Features
- allow users to capture images using their camera
- allow users to save their predictions
